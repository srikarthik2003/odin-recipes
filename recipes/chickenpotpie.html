        <li>1 small green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) can white kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>4 ounces 1/3-less-fat cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup jarred mild salsa verde</li>
        <li>1 (4-ounce) can chopped green chilis, undrained</li>
        <li>1 (9-inch) refrigerated pie crust (such as PillsburyÂ®)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic, and cook, 
            stirring often, until slightly softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture smells nutty, about 1 minute. 
            Stir cumin, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper until well combined. </li>
        <li>Gradually stir in broth and continue to cook over medium, stirring occasionally,
             until thickened and smooth, about 3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add chicken, beans, cream cheese, salsa verde, and chiles. Cook, stirring constantly,
             until cream cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and spread chicken mixture in an even layer.
              Allow to cool for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>While filling cools, unfurl pie crust on a sheet of parchment paper and roll into an 11-inch circle.
             Fold dough edges under to create a 10-inch circle; crimp edges, if desired. Gently place pie crust over filling in skillet. 
             Use a paring knife, cut four 1-inch-long slits into top of pie crust to allow steam to escape. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow pie to cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
