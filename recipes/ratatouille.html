        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>

        <li>2 cups peeled and diced eggplant</li>

        <li>2 cups chopped zucchini</li>

        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>

        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper</li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) package frozen cheese ravioli</li>

        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); spray a 2 1/2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.</li>

        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the garlic, onion, 
            and eggplant with the garlic until the vegetables have begun to soften, about 8 minutes. 
            Stir in the zucchini, bell pepper, tomatoes, basil, parsley, salt, and black pepper;
            bring the mixture to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
            until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.</li>

        <li>Cook the frozen ravioli as directed on the package; drain. Spread the cooked ravioli in a layer into 
            the bottom of the prepared baking dish; spoon the hot vegetables over the ravioli. Sprinkle with the cheese.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
